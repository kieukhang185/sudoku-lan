# 🧩 Sudoku LAN – Single and Multiplayer (2-Players)
A simple Sudoku game designed for **local LAN multiplayer**, where **two players connect from different devices** and play on the **same shared board in real time**.

---

## 📖 Introduction
Sudoku LAN is a web-based Sudoku game that supports:
- Single player
- Two players on the same shared board or tow same board
- Real-time updates
- Turn-based scoring
- Works on desktop + mobile
- LAN-friendly (play over local Wi-Fi)

Players connect using:
```text
shared.html?room=hia1p43&difficulty=easy&player=1
shared.html?room=hia1p43&difficulty=easy&player=2
```
Example: `http://192.168.1.50:3000/shared.html?room=hia1p43&difficulty=easy&player=2`

Refreshing the page keeps the same player number as long as `?player=1` is kept in the URL.
